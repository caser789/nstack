// Package fdbased provided the implementation of data-link layer endpoints
// backed by boundary-preserving file descriptors (e.g., TUN devices,
// seqpacket/datagram sockets).
//
// FD based endpoints can be used in the networking stack by calling New() to
// create a new endpoint, and then passing it as an argument to
// Stack.CreateNIC().
